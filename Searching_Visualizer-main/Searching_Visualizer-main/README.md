# Searching visualizer

I developed a project that implements both binary and linear search using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The array is generated automatically, and users can watch the search process as it navigates through the numbers. The interface is visually appealing, with CSS animations highlighting the elements being compared during each step of the search. This setup offers an engaging way to explore search algorithms without needing user input for the array.
